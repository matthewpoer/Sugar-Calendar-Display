This program is intended to retrieve data from a given SugarCRM system. Data 
involved will be from the Calendar modules: Calls, Meetings and Tasks. Data 
will be sorted based in the assigned user and stacked according in order of 
occurance, then formatted and presented in an HTML calendar for use on a web 
page. 

It is worth noting that this is my first experience with Ruby, but not with
SugarCRM.
