PHP Based Calendar-page Generator for SugarCRM
==============================================

This script will pull Meeting and Call recrods from a provided SugarCRM instance, then
list out these events (in 15-minute intervals) by User. 

Times are converted to America/New_York (Eastern Standard Time). 

It was originally attempted in Ruby but due to time constraints I gave up on that route
and went back to my native PHP. I utilize Asa Kusuma awesome SugarCRM REST API Class as
a wrapper for my connection to SugarCRM. 

The generated HTML calendar is not incredible, but can be used as a basis for other things.
